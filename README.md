# routing_algorithm
This is a python project for implementing a routing protocol with bellman ford (distance vector) algorithm using socket and multithreaded programming.

# Project members
- [Sharif Ahmad](github.com/sharifahmad2061)
- [Asad Nawaz](github.com/asadnawaz126)

# Project distribution
- Asad Nawaz
    - Project research and design is part of Asad. He has to study and know about the nitty gritty of bellman ford algorithm and get an understanding of the said algorithm.
- Sharif Ahmad
    - Project implementation is part of Sharif where he has to implement the protocol using socket and multi threaded programming in python.
